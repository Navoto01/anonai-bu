# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Voice Mode feature enables users to interact with the AI assistant through voice input instead of typing. When there is no text input and the AI is not responding, the send button transforms into a voice icon. Clicking it opens a dedicated Voice Mode screen where users can speak naturally, with automatic speech detection, pause/resume functionality, and seamless AI integration with Groq AI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a voice icon in the send button when there's no input and the AI isn't responding, so that I can easily access voice interaction mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the text input field is empty AND the AI is not currently responding THEN the send button SHALL display a voice/microphone icon
2. WHEN there is text in the input field OR the AI is responding THEN the send button SHALL display the normal send icon
3. WHEN the user clicks the voice icon THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Voice Mode screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated Voice Mode screen with intuitive controls, so that I can interact with the AI through voice in a focused environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Voice Mode screen opens THEN the system SHALL display a modern, animated interface with the title "Voice Mode"
2. WHEN the Voice Mode screen is active THEN the system SHALL show two buttons at the bottom: "Pause" on the left and "Finish" on the right
3. WHEN the Voice Mode screen opens THEN the system SHALL automatically start listening for voice input
4. WHEN the Voice Mode screen is displayed THEN the interface SHALL be professional and visually appealing with smooth animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic speech detection and processing, so that I can speak naturally without manually controlling when to start and stop recording.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Voice Mode screen opens THEN the system SHALL begin listening to the microphone for English speech
2. WHEN the system detects speech input THEN it SHALL continue recording until no new words are heard for 2 seconds
3. WHEN the 2-second silence period ends THEN the system SHALL stop recording and send the captured text to Groq AI
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL automatically resume listening for the next voice input
5. WHEN speech is being detected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate active listening

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want pause and finish controls, so that I can manage the voice interaction session according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Pause" button THEN the system SHALL stop listening to the microphone completely
2. WHEN the system is paused THEN the AI SHALL not process any input or provide responses
3. WHEN the system is paused THEN the user SHALL be able to resume by clicking the pause button again (which becomes a "Resume" button)
4. WHEN the user clicks the "Finish" button THEN the system SHALL exit the Voice Mode screen and return to the main chat interface
5. WHEN paused THEN all voice processing SHALL be completely silent and inactive

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice input to integrate seamlessly with Groq AI, so that I get accurate and contextual responses to my spoken queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is captured THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using speech recognition
2. WHEN text is ready THEN the system SHALL send it to Groq AI (not ChatGPT) for processing
3. WHEN the AI response is received THEN the system SHALL display it in the Voice Mode interface
4. WHEN the AI response is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically resume listening for the next voice input
5. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want modern animations and professional visual design, so that the voice interaction feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning to Voice Mode THEN the system SHALL use smooth, professional animations
2. WHEN the system is listening THEN it SHALL display animated visual indicators (such as pulsing microphone icon or waveform)
3. WHEN the system is processing speech THEN it SHALL show appropriate loading/processing animations
4. WHEN the AI is responding THEN it SHALL display the response with smooth text animations
5. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN they SHALL provide tactile feedback through animations
6. WHEN the system state changes (listening/paused/processing) THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and clearly communicated through visual cues
